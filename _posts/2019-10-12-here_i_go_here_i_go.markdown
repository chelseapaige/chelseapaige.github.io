When I began college many years ago, the idea of a computer science degree was like a dirty little secret. I had taken HTML coding courses in High School, but being the only female in the courses was discouraging. I quickly chose a business degree because it seemed the "most fun". Once I was out in the world of 9-5, I realized my passions laid with techonology instead of marketing plans. My first tech job was QA testing a very simple softwear, and it quickly evolved to project managing the developers as I seemed to be the only one in the startup who understood their lingo. A few years later I was frustrated with dealing directly with clients and wanted to know more about the HOW of the code. When I expressed this interest to my mentor, he bluntly told me that "girls" like me don't really code. 

Flash forward to now- a "girl like me" is coding, and just finished her first week of her dream program. While I'm more comfortable with HTML, CSS and Python, I'm adapting to Ruby (terms like truthiness make me laugh though). I was nervous to start this program due to social anxiety and a very busy toddler to manage on an every day basis. However, bedtime coding sessions are working well and I'm meeting really nice people in my program. I'm excited to see where this next week takes me, and I'm loving feeling that I AM smart enough to do this!
